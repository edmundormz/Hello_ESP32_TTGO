# ESP32 Dev module

The ESP32 is a microcontroller developed by [Espressif Systems](http://espressif.com/). Known as a WiFi Module, this microcontroller has the ability to perform WiFi related activities like Internet of things applications and home automation. Ranging in price and features, there are many types of ESP32 modules available, but all of them are incredibly useful for IoT world.

## Requirements

- [An ESP32 module](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663).
- [Arduino IDE 1.6.5 or higher](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- [Ubidots library](https://github.com/ubidots/esp32/archive/main.zip)

## Setup

1. Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
2. Install the ESP32 Platform to your Arduino IDE. Please reference the following links depending of your operating system. The following Espressif links will prompt you to install the ESP32 to your computer. 

**Note:** If you are using Linux or Mac operating systems, an additional step is required as you need to install the ESP32 Platform to the Arduino IDE from your computer's terminal first. Use the below links to execute the required Terminal functions and then return to this guide to continue the ESP32 integration.

- [Windows](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/windows.md)
- [Debian/Ubuntu Linux](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/debian_ubuntu.md)
- [MacOS](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/mac.md)
3. After installing the ESP32 platform using the above Espressif Systems links, you will be prompted to restart the Arduino IDE - be sure to do so. 
5. Select the ESP32 board from **Tools > Board > ESP32 Dev module**.
6. Download the **Ubidots library** [here](https://github.com/ubidots/esp32/archive/main.zip).
7. Now, click on **Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library**.
8. Select the .ZIP file of Ubidots and then "**Accept**".
9. Close the Arduino IDE and open it again.

## Constructor

### Ubidots

`Ubidots(const char* token, UbiServer server, IotProtocol iot_protocol)`

Creates an Ubidots instance.

**NOTE:** If you use HTTP or TCP to send data, the client will implement TLS 2.0 based on the [example for ESP32 secure client](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/libraries/HTTPClient/examples/BasicHttpsClient/BasicHttpsClient.ino) by Espressif, to secure your data. Keep in mind that due to the security checks needed, the packet may take a little more time to be sent than without TLS. If you wish to send data insecurely, use UDP or any of the available examples at our [docs](https://ubidots.com/docs/hw/).

As Ubidots makes its best to secure your data, we do not guarantee any issue, data miss or external sniff coming from the native secure client or bugs in the library.

- @token, [Required]. Your Ubidots unique account [TOKEN](http://help.ubidots.com/user-guides/find-your-token-from-your-ubidots-account).
- @server, [Optional], [Options] = [`UBI_INDUSTRIAL`, `<custom_server>`], [Default] = `UBI_INDUSTRIAL`. The server to send data, set `<custom_server>` if you wish to point to another private server given by Ubidots.
- @iot_protocol, [Optional], [Options] = [`UBI_HTTP`, `UBI_TCP`, `UBI_UDP`], [Default] = `UBI_TCP`. The IoT protocol that you will use to send or retrieve data.

## Methods

`void add(const char *variable_label, float value, char *context, unsigned long dot_timestamp_seconds, unsigned int dot_timestamp_millis)`

Adds a dot with its related value, context and timestamp to be sent to a certain data source.

**Important:** The max payload length is 700 bytes, if your payload is greater it won't be properly sent. You can see on your serial console the payload to send if you call the `setDebug(bool debug)` method and pass a true value to it.

- @variable_label, [Required]. The label of the variable where the dot will be stored.
- @value, [Required]. The value of the dot.
- @context, [Optional]. The dot's context.
- @dot_timestamp_seconds, [Optional]. The dot's timestamp in seconds.
- @dot_timestamp_millis, [Optional]. The dot's timestamp number of milliseconds. If the timestamp's milliseconds values is not set, the seconds will be multplied by 1000.

`float get(const char* device_label, const char* variable_label)`

Returns as float the last value of the dot from the variable.

- @device_label, [Required]. The device label which contains the variable to retrieve values from.
- @variable_label, [Required]. The variable label to retrieve values from.

`void addContext(char *key_label, char *key_value)`

Adds to local memory a new key-value context key. The method inputs must be char pointers. The method allows to store up to 10 key-value pairs.

- @key_label, [Required]. The key context label to store values.
- @key_value, [Required]. The key pair value.

`void getContext(char *context)`

Builds the context according to the chosen protocol and stores it in the context char pointer.

- @context, [Required]. A char pointer where the context will be stored.

`void setDebug(bool debug)`

Makes available debug messages through the serial port.

- @debug, [Required]. Boolean type to turn off/on debug messages.

`bool send(const char* device_label, const char* device_name);`

Sends all the data added using the add() method. Returns true if the data was sent.

- @device_label, [Optional], [Default] = Device's MAC Address. The device label to send data. If not set, the device's MAC address will be used.
- @device_name, [Optional], [Default] = @device_label. The device name otherwise assigned if the device doesn't already exist in your Ubidots account. If not set, the device label parameter will be used. **NOTE**: Device name is only supported through TCP/UDP, if you use another protocol, the device name will be the same as device label.

`bool wifiConnect(const char* ssid, const char* password)`

Attempts to connect to the cloud using WiFi with the specified credentials.

- @ssid, [Optional], [Required]. WiFi SSID to connect to name.
- @password, [Required]. WiFi password credential.

`bool wifiConnected()`

Returns true if the device is connected to the cloud using WiFi.

`bool serverConnected();`

Returns true if the device has a socket opened with Ubidots.

`void setDeviceType(const char* deviceType)`

Sets a [device type](https://help.ubidots.com/en/articles/2129204-device-types) to be added in your request. This method works only if you set HTTP as iot protocol in your instance constructor.
